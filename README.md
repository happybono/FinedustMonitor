## Specifications
### Scenarios
* Measuring the fine dust contamination level in the air in real time. The value is displayed on the OLED Screen, and updated every second.
* Measuring the current temperature.
* Refining data and synchronize with the web-based cloud service. (e.g. [ThingSpeak](https://www.thingspeak.com/), [Plaive](https://plaive.10make.com/))

### Connections
* 1 x Micro-USB

### Wireless
* IEEE 802.11 b/g/n Wi-Fi technology.

### Battery life 
* Up to 24 hours of typical device usage.
* Testing consisted of full-time active use until complete battery discharge. 
* Wi-Fi was connected to a network.
* Syncs data once every minute with PM 10.0 and PM 2.5 readings from the Nova PM (SDS011) Sensor and Temperature reading from the DS18820 Temperature Sensor.
* Battery life may varies significantly with settings, usage and other factors.

## Apparatus (Equipment)
### Platform
* ESP8266 NodeMCU

### SDS011 Dust Sensor
* Soldering required.
* D1 : TX of SDS011

### 0.96" SSD1306 I2C OLED Display 
* Soldering required.
* D3 : Data, D2 : Clock

### DS18B20 Temperature Sensor (Thermometer)
* Soldering required.
* D4 : Data

### Blank EUB-2300C Portable Battery
* Micro-USB : Power
